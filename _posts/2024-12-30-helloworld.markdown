# Hi, I'm Liam ðŸ‘‹

And this is my blog, **Loop Detected**.

## What's the name about?

This blog is named for **HTTP status code 508**. Per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/508):

> The HTTP `508 Loop Detected` server error response status code indicates that the entire operation failed because it encountered an infinite loop 
> while processing a request with `Depth: infinity`.

I spent a while brainstorming ideas for the name, and couldn't come up with anything good. But after stumbling on this while on MDN, it felt... right.

## What's the blog about?

I've given this site the tagline "_A site about tech, books, and everything in between_". That's a pretty good summary, if you ask me.
More specifically, I'll be posting:

- **Structured tutorials** on stuff I found poorly documented
- **Opinions and rants** on the messy world of tech
- **Book reviews** (I've been trying to read more classics lately!)
- **Life updates**, like what I've been up to lately
- **Anything else** that's on my mind

## What's the author about?

I'm a **[web dev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) enthusiast** and **Computer Science student** at **[Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/)**.
In the world of web technologies, I have experience with:
- **React** with Hooks, React Router
- **TailwindCSS**, Bootstrap, SASS
- **Spring Boot**, Spring Web, Spring Data, Spring Security, etc.
- **Express**, MongoDB, Node, TypeScript
- **Jekyll** (for this blog!)

I'm also an avid reader! I've read a lot of **speculative fiction** (favourites include [**His Dark Materials**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials) 
and [**The Dispossessed**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed)), and serve on the committee of the Sci-Fi & Fantasy society at Trinity. But right
now, I'm trying to read more **classics**, and on this blog I'll be logging that journey.

## Anything else I should know?

If you're into **RSS**, you can **subscribe** from the homepage. It sucks so few sites do RSS now, because it's genuinely a great protocol, especially for small blogs like this one.
I'm looking into setting up other ways for users to be notified about new posts (email? BlueSky? LinkedIn?), but for now please **bookmark** the site if you want to keep up to date.

If you want to **contact me**, you can leave a **comment** on this or any other blog post! If you want to reach out to me directly, my **email** is in the footer.
