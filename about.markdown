# Hi, I'm Liam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **web dev enthusiast** and **CS student** at Trinity College in Dublin.

I use this website to post:
- **Structured tutorials** on stuff I found poorly documented
- **Opinions and rants** on the messy world of tech
- **Book reviews** (I've been trying to read more classics lately!)
- **Life updates**, like what I've been up to lately
- **Anything else** that's on my mind

While I have you, don't forget to add me on:
